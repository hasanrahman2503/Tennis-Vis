# How we can use our model?
We can use our model to evaluate a players moves, see how favourably or unfavourable the model views it. Next we can try alter some of the paramters e.g.(ball_bounce_v) if increasing it significantly improved the outcome from the model, that could be an area of improvment. With the reverse also being true.
