## Our goals
We want to be able to feed data to our model, and fit the data to the results. Through machine learning it would be able to correctly predict if it results in and Ace or not.
The ultimate objective is that we can use this model to improve real life outcomes. In a simple scenario we might have our model show that higher hit speeds create more aces.
So if players hit harder that might improve a players ability to get aces could be a plausible insight.
This is greatly oversimplifying for example correlation doesnâ€™t always mean causation.
Another thing is it is unlikely that it is a simple linear relationship.
Perhaps there is an optimal hitspeed. Not too slow, not too fast. This optimal hit speed could depends on a multitude of factors.
