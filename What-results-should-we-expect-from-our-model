There should be some residual in our model, this is because our data is incomplete for example hitspeed is rounded so it doesnâ€™t have its true value. This is largely insignificant, the other much more significant factor will be from the fact that tennis is a two player game. So a seemingly bad serve may give a ace against a bad player and vice versa.
